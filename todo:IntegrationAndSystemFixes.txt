===========================================================TODO:INDIVIDUAL-FIXES============================================================================

(Incomplete) Evelyn: Fix lifetime generation methods, update to latest version of averaging table structure

(Incomplete) Evelyn: Fix populateRawData to only populate with filled data rows (must have complete row with secondary current, secondary voltage and winding temp, all per phase)

(Complete) Orion: add a "manufacture date" section to the add transformer form


===========================================================TODO:INTEGRATION-FIXES============================================================================
(Complete) Evelyn and Alex: Connect ML to DB, test locally to ensure process runs
    -health scores 
    -forecast results

(Incomplete) Evelyn and Orion: Move initialization of transformer/healthScore/tables from streamlitApp.py to fast.py to mitigate screen freezing
    -move addTransformer() and deleteTransformer() to thier appropriate places in fast.py:
    -move run_health_monitoring() to where addTransformer() is called

(Incomplete) Evelyn and Orion: Add scheduler to fast.py to mitigate race conditions during data updates and database corruption during updates. Fast.py is only function that does the insertions, it has internal queing methods that make it a better candidate
