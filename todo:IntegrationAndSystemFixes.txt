===========================================================TODO:INDIVIDUAL-FIXES============================================================================

(Complete) Evelyn: Fix lifetime generation methods, update to latest version of averaging table structure
    - (Complete) Lifetime Continuous Rework
    - (Complete) Lifetime Transient Rework - redo tables to consider overall percentage remaining, not just consumption for that time period

(Complete) Evelyn: Fix populateRawData to only populate with filled data rows (must have complete row with non- zero secondary current, secondary voltage and winding temp, all per phase. Rest is optional)

(Incomplete) Evelyn: add forecasting functionality to transformer: change current parameters to go from load1 to load2 given x lag timestamps based on transformer time constant
    - needs to return a table showing the load change (from x percent to y percent) and the estimated HS 
    - add input features for KVA, winding material and age

(Incomplete) Evelyn: update and refresh functionality implementation to 

(Complete) Orion: add a box to collect KVA for add/delete page. needs to be a numeric input

(Complete) Orion: when database is empty/freshly initialized, red error message continues. see down below under todo-integration-fixes. Issue is with empty health scores table

(Incomplete) Alex: fix: Why is status of variable (voltage, current, etc) red if it is under rated value? All 'overall_score' values are also the same across the transformers we have in the DB

(Incomplete) Alex: on LTR_B01, rated winding temp in health scores table displays as 2.5, pattern does not occur with the other transformers in DB

===========================================================TODO:INTEGRATION-FIXES============================================================================
(Incomplete) Alex: Forecasting tables with recent transient data

(Incomplete) Alex: Connect ML to DB, test locally to ensure process runs
    - (Complete) health scores 
    - (Incomplete) forecast results

(Complete) Evelyn and Orion: Move initialization of transformer/healthScore/tables from streamlitApp.py to fast.py to mitigate screen freezing
    - (Complete) move addTransformer() and deleteTransformer() to thier appropriate places in fast.py:
    - (Complete) move run_health_monitoring() to where addTransformer() is called
    - (Complete) test and verify it works
