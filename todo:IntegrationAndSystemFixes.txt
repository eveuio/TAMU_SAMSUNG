1) Evelyn and Alex: Connect ML to DB, test locally to ensure process runs
2) Evelyn: Fix lifetime generation methods, update to latest version of averaging table structure
3) Evelyn and Orion: Move initialization of transformer/healthScore/tables from streamlitApp.py to fast.py to mitigate screen freezing
4) Evelyn and Orion: Add scheduler to fast.py to mitigate race conditions and database corruption. Fast.py is only function that does the insertions, it has internal queing methods that make it a better candidate
