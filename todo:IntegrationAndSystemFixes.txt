===========================================================TODO:INDIVIDUAL-FIXES============================================================================

(Incomplete) Alex: fix: Why is status of variable (voltage, current, etc) red if it is under rated value? All 'overall_score' values are also the same across the transformers we have in the DB

(Incomplete) Alex: on LTR_B01, rated winding temp in health scores table displays as 2.5, pattern does not occur with the other transformers in DB

(Incomplete) Alex: fix lifetime prediction exponential, data in chart is currently from data processing lifetime percent consumption table

(Incomplete) Alex: Forecasting tables with recent transient data

(Incomplete) Alex: Provide evelyn with min number of datapoints needed to run both health monitoring and forecast model



(Complete) Orion: Add an option in the createTransformer form to upload an excel sheet. It should be named the same as whatever was 
                    put in the transformer name box, else have the program rename it as such. The filepath needed should be TAMU_SAMSUNG/DataProcessing/CompleteTransformerData

(Complete) Orion: Add an additional form for data updates that takes a transformer name and an excel sheet. If that transformer name doesnt exist in the DB, 
                    throw message saying it {transformerName} doesnt exist in the database. Else, replace the sheet that currently exists in TAMU_SAMSUN/DataProcessing/CompleteTransformerData



(Complete) Evelyn: modify addTransformer and updateMetrics for improved runtime.

(Complete) Evelyn: add transient lifetime function, forecasting function and health score function under update-tables in fast.py

(Complete) Evelyn: make set of dummy loading curve for 80-120 percent transformer usage; needed for demo validation

(Incomplete) Evelyn: add error checking to createxfmr logic to ensure excel file is greater than or equal to min num rows needed by health monitoring and forecast engine

(Incomplete) Evelyn: Ensure uploaded sheets have at least 9 columns plus a datetime column in correct format

==================================ERROR-MESSAGES================================================================================================

- Add checking to ensure user cannot submit an empty form. Must have Transformer Name (non-empty string) and manufacture date (4 digits or len() =4 ) and non=zero rated values

-Add checking to ensure user cannot use 'delete transformer' when there are no transformers in DB
