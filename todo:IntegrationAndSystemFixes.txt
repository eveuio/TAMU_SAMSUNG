In order; things to do/fix:

1) Evelyn and Alex: Connect ML to DB, test locally to ensure process runs

2) Evelyn: Fix lifetime generation methods, update to latest version of averaging table structure

3) Evelyn: Fix populateRawData to only populate with filled data rows (must have complete row with secondary current, secondary voltage and winding temp, all per phase)

3) Evelyn and Orion: Move initialization of transformer/healthScore/tables from streamlitApp.py to fast.py to mitigate screen freezing
    -move addTransformer() and deleteTransformer() to thier appropriate places in fast.py:
    -move run_health_monitoring() to where addTransformer() is called

4) Evelyn and Orion: Add scheduler to fast.py to mitigate race conditions during data updates and database corruption during updates. Fast.py is only function that does the insertions, it has internal queing methods that make it a better candidate
    -Pseudocode: 
        @app.on_event("startup")
        def on_startup():
            """Run at API startup."""
            # Step 1: Catch up on missed updates
            check_for_missed_updates()     # function from database class

            # Step 2: Start scheduler for weekly updates
            scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
            scheduler.add_job(
                update_transformer_average_data,     # function from database class

                day_of_week="sat",
                hour=2,
                minute=0
            )
            scheduler.start()

            app.state.scheduler = scheduler
            print("Scheduler started: updates every Saturday at 2 AM.")


        @app.on_event("shutdown")
        def on_shutdown():
            app.state.scheduler.shutdown()
