-remove local file dependencies everywhere except database file in preparation for eFCMS pulls
-
-Create function for prediction model data input
    -later: how to improve file storage, potentially make a second DB for these
-create actual model
-corrupted a file by accident, need to redownload and reintegrate



Blitz TODO:
- 1) modify alex system to run on first initialization of transformer and then every day after that
    -threads on ML prediction
    -threads on healthScore graphs or tables

- 2)modify addTransformer to generate the rest of the tables without explicitly adding a transformer object
    -need to check if new row added to master list, if so then run thread and initialize initial insertion and table creation
    -just remove insertion of object to transformer master table

    -idea: add function to check size or number of transformers in master table, and return the most recent transformers   
        -what if multiple inserted in the window? will need to keep track of previously initialized transformer names
        -can combat this with checking if their full range table exists in the database
        -also needs to check for lsit of removed transformers and delete associated tables. 
            -or, put into an archived state. 
            -idea: add an active or inactive label, could also apply to new transformers 
                -labels: new, archived/inactive, active
                -need to change label once added or deleted 

-3) Finish table of needed metrics for delivery to SAS Joey so he can begin scripting
    -need to include instructions on how we need them
        -one function to pull historical data for the data points given a transformer name
        -one function to pull last 


Overall workflow in main:
    -run update transformer metrics
        -only run on those with an active status tag
    -check for new/archived transformer status in main table
        -if new, initialize tables and historical metrics
        -if archived or active, do nothing

10am-3pm: hot spot modeling
3pm to 8 pm: 1 through 3 above





Trends seen with HS prediction;
    -Changing C changes fit to graph, like vertical axis
    -changing gamma effects underfitting and overfitting
    -Epsilon
